You want to save file "Alpha" in your home directory. 

for those that arent to familiar with bash follow these tips
make sure you:
chmod +x def       #this makes the command executable

as well you can make life easy and move def into your /bin folder
or which ever directory you want that is exported to PATH

its a simple tool you can change what ever you want in it to make your life easy. 

I set the color variables, I only used red, but you can add them anywhere you want color.

But this is just a fun little script I made to practice my bash, and save some nano seconds when doing ctf's.
