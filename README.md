just trying to teach myself some scripting. very basic but you gotta start somewhere.

The def file is my all in one encrypt base64, base32 and decrypt base64,base32 as well as Hexadecimal.

The b64 and db64 are just encrypt and decrypt. Honestly the b64 is likely the only useful one being that most ctf's use base64

But this is all just a learning experience, its likely best to take from what I did and modify it for your own purpose what ever that may be.
